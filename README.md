# BLE Scanner

### About

This project is an expansion to my older [iBeaconScanner] project allowing support for more than just iBeacons! 

It is all very much a work in progress at the moment, there is no interface to work with as all my work so far has just been debugging. I am currently still trying to work out the best way to obtain accurate and frequent updates from scanning the advertisment data and support for [Estimote Stickers] is only half implemented.

### TODO

* Figure out a better way of getting frequent updates to the advertisment data.
* Implement a basic UI for scanning.
* Finish Estimote Sticker advertisment packet parsing.
